            <h3>Define and discuss 'cloud computing'. What is it, what does it mean?</h3>
            <p> Cloud computing is the the ability to give many computing services that would otherwise not be available to the average developer.

            <h3>Discuss the primary advantages of using the cloud.</h3>
            <p> Accoring to the microsoft azure docs, the primary benefits are: 'cost, speed, global scale, productivity, performance, reliability, and security'.  Out of that list
                I think scalability is the most impressive feature of cloud computing.  This allows a startup to build a project and if the project goes viral over night, as long as 
                the project is structured right, the server space can expand to meet the resource needs.

            <h3>Discuss the primary concerns or risks of cloud computing</h3>
            <p> One of the major concerns is security.  The cloud is just a pr term for Amazon, Google, or Azure keeping your data on a centralized server.  This means that they are huge targets
                for attacks.  For developers there is a concern about introducing flawed code that takes up more server space than planed.  This can make an app that was supposed to cost $100 dollars
                end up costing $100k+.  Its probably the most terrifying thing I know about that I am also capable of accidentally doing.

            <h3>Identify and describe the primary cloud computing services. Discuss who supports or provides the services. Discuss some
            of the key features that distinguish each of the services.</h3>
            <p> The two big ones are AWS and AZURE.  AWS seems like it has an overwhelming amount of services to choose from.  It would be good if a niche project needs to be deployed.
                AZURE is nice because it integrates with microsoft products very easily such as vs code and visual studio.  In my opinion AZURE has an easier UI and has better documentation.

            <h3>Identify and discuss technologies and applications that have taken advantage of cloud services.</h3>
            <p> The one I used for my project was a continuous integration and continuos delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.  This allows the deployment of staging, qa, production etc. sites continuously
                while making sure that the code meets deployment standards.  In big code bases this is helpful by preventing potentially sensitive data, logic errors, and compatibility issues Form
                going live.

            <h3>What is you overall impression of cloud computing and its future?</h3>
            <p> I used to have more mixed feeling about cloud, but now that I am using it more I can see the benefits much more.  I think in the future the trend will decentralize more of these services.  
                I think this will be better for security and cost, but it will come at the cost of resource flexibility.  I think cloud will be a tool thats available for the rest of my career, but it 
                might not be the best tool for every job the way it is now.
