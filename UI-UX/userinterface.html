            <h3>Identify and Discuss the primary concepts.</h3>
            <p>
                One main concept is to keep the interface free from clutter.  This means not making it complex with too many elements.  Another concept that is necessary for a good user
                interface is to have the styling be consistent through out the app.  The features of the app should also be positioned in spots where the user is drawn to them.

            <h3>Identify and discuss the technologies involved when working with UI</h3>
            <p>
                A graphical user interface (gui) is a base level way for users to input commands and view outputs from the app.  Some types of guis are forms.  A form is way for 
                a user to enter multiple pieces of information.  Another similar way for users to interact with an app is through a menu.  This is a common way of letting the users 
                navigate through the app.  The most basic form of UI is the command line interface.

            <h3>Identify and discuss the techniques or skills that are useful.</h3>
            <p>
                Useful skills are being able to come up with designs that captivate the user.  This can be done by finding the right pictures, color pallet, and text fonts.  More 
                importantly its finding the right combination of all those pieces in order to have a design that feels natural to the user. Some sort of artistic background can 
                help a lot with coming up with good user interfaces.
