            <h3>Identify and discuss the primary concepts and goals of UX.</h3>
            <p>
                The main purpose of user experience, or UX, is for the customer to get the most out of the software or a product that uses software. GeeksforGeeks list four steps to take
                into consideration when creating ux.  The first is the requirements or understanding the problem that needs to be solved.  The second is Design alternatives which is knowing
                if there is other software that could be used instead.  Prototyping is the next step where the designer makes sure that goals of the app are being met. The last is evaluation
                where the ux is inspected for ways it can be improved.

            <h3>Identify and discuss the technologies involved working with UX</h3>
            <p>
                one of the promising new areas in user experience technologies is with augmented reality and virtual reality.  They are able to immerse the user in the software by creating a world
                that mirrors reality in virtual realities case, and provides added features to reality in augmented realities case.  Both of these techs can involve touchless, or gesture
                control, experience.  These are done by trying head and eye movements.

            <h3>Identify and discuss the techniques and skills that are useful when working with UX.</h3>
            <p>
                There are many techniques that a designer can use in order to figure out what a good experience would be.  One is through focus groups where people are asked questions
                around the app.  Surveys are another tool thats used in the same way as focus groups in order to get an idea what customers are looking for.  An important one is watching
                how the user interacts with the app.  this is called naturalistic observation.
