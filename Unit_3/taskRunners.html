            <h3>What was the motivation for creating Python?</h3>
            <p>Guido Van Rossum released python in 1991. He wanted a language that was easy to read for developers and
                that took less code to write a project. <a

            <h3>What are the strengths of the Python language?</h3>
            <p>Python's main strength is that it is easy to write since it was designed with the developer in mind.
                Python also has an extensive standard library making it popular across many fields. Not related to the
                language itself, the job market is reliable since it is one of the most used languages. <a

            <h3>What are the weaknesses or issues with the Python language?</h3>
            <p>Python owes most of its weaknesses to it being a run time, dynamically typed language. This impacts the
                speed making it slower relative to other language and the memory cost is higher since the types are not
                static <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disadvantages-of-python/">Source</a> </p>

            <h3>Identify 2 or 3 sources for Python commands, syntax, etc. documentation references. </h3>
            <p>Probably the first place to look for current python documention is the python foundation's docs <a
                    href="https://www.python.org/">source</a>. When a more in depth explanation is required
                geeksforgeeks usually has accurate and in depth explanations of concepts and features <a
                    href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/">Source</a> </p>

            <h3>How and why is Python being used in today's development environment?</h3>
            <p>One of python's most popular web frameworks, Django, says 'The web framework for perfectionists with
                deadlines' in its banner <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Source</a>. They advertise this
                because Django is a quick and easy way to get content deployed to the web. Apps that are designed to
                display data, particularly machine learning apps, might want to use Django. Django also boasts
                dependable security and 'batteries included' which means it has auth, admin, and session packages out of
                the box <a href="https://pythongeeks.org/advantages-disadvantages-of-django/">Source</a>.</p>

            <h3>What does the job market look like for Python skills?</h3>
            <p>Due to the popularity of python it is attractive to companies since they know they have a large pool of
                developers to choose from. Also, it is used heavily in machine learning and data analyst roles which are
                areas that have been consistently growing. Currently indeed returns 398 job openings in Iowa with the
                python tag <a href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Python&l=50131&vjk=ce1e2697ecda1859">Source</a>, and
                StackOverflow returns 76 remote jobs with the python tag <a
                    href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?r=true&tl=python">Source</a>.</p>
