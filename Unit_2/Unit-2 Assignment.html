	<p>1. Define a String variable called schoolName and assign it a value of DMACC.</p>
	<p>2. Define a String variable called courseName and assign it a value of WDV221 Intro Javascript</p>
	<p>3. Define a Numeric variable called testScore and assign it a value of 100.00. </p>
	<p>4. Define a Numeric variable called courseGrade. Do not give it a value.</p>
	<p>5. Define a Boolean variable called courseCompleted. Give it a value of false.</p>
	
	<script>
		var schoolName = "DMACC"; // setting a string variable
		var courseName = "WDV221 Intro Javascript"; //setting a string variable
		var testScore = 100.00; // setting an int variable
		var courseGrade = new Number(); //initializing a variable as a number without declaring a value
		var courseCompleted = false; // setting a bool to false
	</script>
	<hr>
	<p>Display the value of all the variables in their own paragraphs below. </p>
	<p>
		<script> // writes all the values of the variables seperated by commas.  CourseGrade was never given a value so its undefined but initialized a number which makes it 0
			document.write(schoolName,", ", courseName,", ", testScore,", ", courseGrade,", ", courseCompleted)
		</script>
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Display the number of characters in the course name.</p>
	<p>
		<script> // use a method to determin the length of courseName
			document.write(courseName.length)
		</script>
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Display the course name as all uppercase letters.</p>
	<p>
		<script> //use a method to change the text of courseName to upper case
			document.write(courseName.toUpperCase())
		</script>
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Using the String Object determine if the course name contains the letters WDV? Look at the String methods. Does one
	or more of them look inside the variable for specific content?</p>
	<p>
		<script> // use a method to determine if the value passed in is in courseName
			var nameContains = "WDV"
			document.write(courseName.includes(nameContains)? "yes, " + nameContains + " is in '" + courseName + "'": "na, "+ nameContains + " is not in '" + courseName + "'")
		</script>
	</p>
	<p>
		<script> //using a prompt to check if the user input is in the phrase
			function numOfTimesContains(phrase, uInput){
				var count = 0
				for(var i = 0; i < phrase.length; i++){
					if(phrase[i] === uInput){						
						count ++
						console.log(phrase[i])
					}
				}
				return count
			}

			var nameContains = prompt("What would you like to search the text for? (case sensitive) ")
			document.write(courseName.includes(nameContains) ? "yes, " + nameContains + " is in '" + courseName + "' " + numOfTimesContains(courseName, nameContains) + " times" : "na, " + nameContains + " is not in '" + courseName + "'")
